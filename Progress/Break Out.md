* # Full Day Camp:
  * ## Creating a new workspace
    * Click the green plus
    * Name it "**your name**_NewMod" (Here's the directory problem, I'm not sure how to solve it)
  * ## Creating Textures:
    * Click on the resources tab on the left side of the screen
    * Click new texture, Create Texture from scratch, ok on default settings
    * Generate from template (They can randomize or create with the drawing tools, based on what they want to make and skill)
    * ^^(See Image 1.2)
    * Click create and save texture as a new texture.
    * Make one for an ingot, tool, block (and possibly armor, if they're finished early.)   
  * ## Creating a New Block
    * First, click on the green plus, then click **Block**
    * From here, you will be able to use the block texture you created earlier. 
    * Then, Change block hardness to 2 (how long it takes to be mined), resistance to 30 (how likely it is to be destroyed by an explosion) and the tool able to destroy it to a pickaxe. 
      * You can also look at Image 2 to see what characteristics other blocks in the game have.
    * Make sure to skip the next few steps until you are at the Block spawning/generation properties.
    * Set the Dimensions to generate in to Surface and Blocks this ore can replace to Blocks STONE. This allows stone blocks to be replaced by your block, and also generates your block on the surface randomly.
    * NOW LETS TEST IT!!!!
    * Click on Build & Run and select Run Client. Look around for your new block or you can find it in your inventory.
  * ## Creating an Ingot
    * Click the green plus again and select Item.
    * Name this "**your name**_Ingot" and leave all settings default
  * ## Making a Recipe For Your Ingot
    * Click that green plus, but this time, select Recipe.
    * Name it "**your name**_Ingot_Recipe"
    * Select smelting for type of recipe, select your ore for the item and the ingot for the output, and then save it.
    *
