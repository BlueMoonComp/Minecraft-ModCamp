  * ## Creating a New Block

    * Then, Change block hardness to 2 (how long it takes to be mined), resistance to 30 (how likely it is to be destroyed by an explosion) and the tool able to destroy it to a pickaxe. 
    * Make sure to skip the next few steps until you are at the Block spawning/generation properties.
