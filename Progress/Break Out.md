* # Full Day Camp:
  * ## Creating a new workspace
   * Click the green plus
   * Name it "**your name**_NewMod" (Here's the directory problem, I'm not sure how to solve it)
  * ## Creating Textures:
   * Click on the resources tab on the left side of the screen
   * Click new texture, Create Texture from scratch, ok on default settings
   * Generate from template (They can randomize or create with the drawing tools, based on what they want to make and skill)
   * ^^(See Image 1.2)
   * Click create and save texture as texture.
   * Make one for a tool, one for a block (and possibly armor, if they're finished early.)   
  * ## Creating a new block
   * First, click on the green plus, then click **Block**
   * From here, you will be able to use the block texture you created earlier. 
   * Then, Change block hardness to 2 (how long it takes to be mined), resistance to 30 (how likely it is to be destroyed by an explosion) and the tool able to destroy it to a pickaxe. 
   * You can also look at Image 2 to see what characteristics other blocks in the game have.
   * Make sure to skip the next few steps until you are at the Block spawning/generation properties.
   * Set the Dimensions to generate in to Surface and Blocks this ore can replace to Blocks STONE.
